# atom-manager
## A custom atom installs manager

## Current Version
### v0.1.0

Basic functionality, running the shortcut to the executable file prompts the user in a command line to enter a number for which atom install to run.

v0.1.0 does not include my installs for atom, running the .exe file will create a brand new atom install in the atom-installs folder.

### Known Issues

* Redirecting PATH is still tedious in comparison to the batch files
* Github desktop is unhappy with committing too many files, such as my atom installs all at once
* Having to press 'Enter' after making the choice is not very smooth
> Figuring out how the input stream works in Rust would be able to fix this

**Special thanks to [Imswebra](https://github.com/imswebra "Github Profile") for his atom setup for c++ and python with the batch scripts**
